                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>
                    I am a dedicated Computer Science student at the University
                    of Minnesota, set to graduate in Spring of 2026. My academic
                    journey is distinguished by a strong GPA of 3.64 and
                    recognition through awards such as the Presidential Emerging
                    Scholar, U-Promise Scholarship, and inclusion on Deanâ€™s
                    List: Summer 2023, Fall 2023, Spring 2024.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have a passion for software development, with proficiency
                    in programming languages like Python, Java, JavaScript,
                    HTML, C, C++, and TypeScript. My technical skills are
                    complemented by experience with tools such as Microsoft
                    Office, AWS, SQL, Bash, VIM, and Git.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside the classroom, I engage in hands-on experience as a
                    Computer Science and Engineering Teaching Assistant, helping
                    students understand complex programming concepts. I'm also
                    active in extracurricular activities, contributing to the
                    University of Minnesota's App Development Club and the
                    Minorities In Tech group, where I collaborate on diverse
                    projects and support initiatives for a more inclusive tech
                    community.
